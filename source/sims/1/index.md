title: A Service Queue Model with Utilization and Maximum Queue Length Statistics
metatitle: Service Queue Model - Utilization & Maximum Queue Length Statistics
metadesc: A service queue model (one service and one queue) with two statistics maximum queue length and service utilization. For simplicity, the model uses abstract (discrete) time and abstracts away from individual customers and from the composition of the queue, which is only represented in terms of its length. The model includes one object type ServiceDesk, and two event types CustomerArrival and CustomerDeparture. Both the random time variable for the recurrence of customer arrival events and the random time variable for modeling the duration of services are discrete.
