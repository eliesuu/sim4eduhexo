 <section class="mbd collapsed"><h1><span>►</span>Simulation Design Model <sup class="expl-req">?</sup></h1>
   <div id="expl-DM" class="expl"></div>

   <p>In this 3rd variant of our Service Desk queuing model, we model a service performed
     by the service desk as an <b><i>activity</i></b> in the sense of a business process activity.
     Activities are special types of events having some duration and using resources. Their duration may
     be either preset to a fixed value or to a random value (in which case they have a scheduled end),
     or it may be determined by the occurrence of an activity end event that is caused by another
     simulation event (in which case they have an open end).</p>

   <section><h1>Information Design Model <sup class="expl-req">?</sup></h1>
     <div id="expl-IDM" class="expl"></div>
     <p>A computational design for the purpose of computing the two statistics <i>maximum queue length</i>
       and <i>service utilization</i> is obtained by modeling the following types of objects, events and activities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>One object type: <b><code>ServiceDesk</code></b> with one (integer-valued) attribute
      <code>queueLength</code>.</li>
    <li>One event type: <b><code>CustomerArrival</code></b> with a reference property <code>serviceDesk</code>
      having the class <code>ServiceDesk</code> as range. As an exogenous event type, <code>CustomerArrival</code>
      has a <code>recurrence</code> function representing a random variable for computing the time in-between
      two subsequent event occurrences.</li>
    <li>One activity type: <b><code>PerformService</code></b> having a resource association with the object type
      <code>ServiceDesk</code> and a function <code>randomDuration</code> representing a random variable
      for computing the duration of a service (as a <code>PerformService</code> activity).</li>
  </ul>
     <p>By modeling the service as a <code>PerformService</code> activity, we get the service desk utilization
       statistics for free, since utilization statistics are computed automatically by a simulator supporting
       activity modeling due to its implementation of the general semantics of activities.</p>
     <p>The object types, event types and activity types described above, together with their participation
       associations, are visually described in the following UML class diagram:</p>

       <img src="media/img/IDM.svg" width="500"/>
       <figcaption>An information design model describing object types and event types.</figcaption>
     </figure>
     <p data-modified="2019-03-13">Since both the <code>recurrence</code> of <code>CustomerArrival</code> events and the <code>serviceDuration</code> 
      of <code>ServicePerformance</code> activities are <em>exponentially</em> distributed, 
      this model corresponds to what is called an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M/M/1_queue'>M/M/1 queue</a> in Queueing Theory.
	  It is well-known that for the variable <i>a</i> denoting the customer arrival rate and <i>s</i> denoting the service performance rate,  
     </p>
     <ol data-modified="2019-03-13">
      <li>the system is only stable if <i>a &lt; s</i>;</li>
      <li>the utilization is <i>a / s</i>;</li>
      <li>the average cycle time (the average time a customer spends in the system) is <i>T = 1 / (s - a)</i>;</li>
      <li>the average number of customers in the system is <i>N = aT</i> (this is <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law'>Little's law</a>).</li>
     </ol>
     <p data-modified="2019-03-13">Notice that these theoretical results can be used for validating the implemented simulation model, e.g., by comparing its computed utilization
      with the theoretical utilization <i>a / s</i>, which would be 1 since in the model <i>a = s = 0.5</i>.</p>
