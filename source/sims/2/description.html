  <section><h1>Information Design Model <sup class="expl-req">?</sup></h1>
    <div id="expl-IDM" class="expl"></div>
    <p>A computational design for the purpose of computing one statistic: the <i>mean response time</i>,
      defined as the average length of time a customer spends in the system from arrival to departure,
      which is equal to the average waiting time plus the average service duration. For being able to compute the
      mean response time, we need to store the arrival time of all arrived customers.
      This can be achieved by explicitly modeling customers as an object type, in addition to service desks. So,
      we get the following types of objects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><code>Customer</code></b> having one (decimal-valued) attribute <code>arrivalTime</code>;</li>
      <li><b><code>ServiceDesk</code></b> having an association with <code>Customer</code> representing the
        multi-valued reference property <code>waitingCustomers</code>, and a random variable
        <code>serviceDuration()</code> that models the random variation of service durations (expressed as
        a function).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are two event types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><code>CustomerArrival</code></b> having two participation associations representing the reference
        properties: (1) <code>customer</code> with the class <code>Customer</code> as range, and (2) <code>serviceDesk</code>
        with the class <code>ServiceDesk</code> as range. As an exogenous event type, <code>CustomerArrival</code>
        has a <code>recurrence</code> function representing a random variable for computing the time in-between
        two subsequent event occurrences.</li>
      <li><b><code>CustomerDeparture</code></b> having one participation association with <code>ServiceDesk</code>
        representing the reference property <code>serviceDesk</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Notice that in our design we don't need the participation association between <code>CustomerDeparture</code> and
      <code>Customer</code> since for any customer departure event the customer concerned can be retrieved by
    getting the first item from the <code>waitingCustomers</code> queue.</p>
    <p>The object types and event types described above, together with their participation associations, are visually described in
      the following UML class diagram:</p>
