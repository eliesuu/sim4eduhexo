   <p>Thomas C. Schelling, who is a co-recipient of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Economics, published a paper
     proposing a theory about the persistence of racial or ethnic segregation despite an environment of
     growing tolerance ("Dynamic Models of Segregation", Journal of Mathematical Sociology 1, 1971, 143-186.).
     He suggested that even if individuals tolerate racial diversity, if they also remain uneasy
     about being a minority in the locality, segregation will still be the equilibrium situation.</p>
   <p>Schelling placed pennies and dimes on a chess board and moved them around according to various rules.
     He interpreted the board as a city, with each square of the board representing a house or a lot.
     He interpreted the pennies and dimes as residents representing any two groups in society,
     such as two different races of people, boys and girls, smokers and non-smokers, etc.
     The neighborhood of a resident occupying any location on the board consisted of the squares
     adjacent to this location. Thus, interior (non-edge) residents could have up to eight neighbors,
     non-corner edge residents could have a maximum of five neighbors, and corner edge residents could have
     a maximum of three neighbors. Rules could be specified that determined whether a particular resident
     was content in her current location. If she was not, she would try to move to another location on
     the board, or possibly just exit the board entirely. As can be expected, Schelling found that
     the board quickly evolved into a strongly segregated location pattern if the residents'
     &quot;contentness rules&quot; were specified so that segregation was heavily favored. Surprisingly,
     however, he also found that initially integrated boards tipped into full segregation even if the
     residents' contentness rules expressed only a mild preference for having neighbors of their own group.</p>

    <p>The conceptual model for studying segregation as a social phenomena describes the behavior of residents as members
    of some group, being either content or uncontent with their neighborhood, and moving to another place
      as a consequence of being uncontent.</p>

      <p>Residential segregation involves residents living at some address as members of some group
        and their neighborhoods as spatial structures. Consequently, potentially relevant object types are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>residential addresses,</li>
        <li>residents,</li>
        <li>groups of residents.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Potentially relevant types of events are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>residents periodically checking their neihborhood for determining if they are content with it,</li>
        <li>residents moving.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Both object types and event types, with their participation associations, can be visually described in
      a UML class diagram, as shown below.</p>

    <p>Research question: what is the degree of segregation obtained with reasonably tolerant residents?</p>
    <p>We can amke the following simplifications as design choices: </p>
    <ul>
    <li>There is no need for using a realistic map with addresses, we can use a grid for representing the residential area.</li>
    <li>A resident occupies a grid cell with x/y coordinates.</li>
    <li>There is no need for representing individual residents. It's sufficient to color grid cells acording to the group of their resident.</li>
    <li>There is no need for events. We can simply use <em>fixed-increment time progression</em> where time increments ("ticks") correspond to implicit time events.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each resident has a neighborhood consisting of the 8 adjacent cells surrounding it,
      both vertically/horizontally (N/E/S/W) and diagonally (NE/SE/SW/NW).</p>
    <p>The <i>OESjs</i> simulation framework provides two forms of grid spaces:
      (1) a simple <i>integer grid</i>, where a grid cell has an integer value that can, for instance, represent the group
      of the resident at this location, and (2) an <i>object grid</i>, where a grid cell is a special type of object
      such that one can define properties for it and associate it with a set of objects that are positioned
      on this grid cell. Obviously, choosing an integer grid as the space model of a simulation implies limitations on
      the information that can be represented per grid cell, but allows larger grid spaces compared to object grids
      because of its smaller memory footprint.</p>
    <p>In the <i>SchellingSegregationModel-1</i>, an integer grid has been chosen as the space model such that the
     integer value of a grid cell being zero represents an empty space location, while a value of greater than zero
     represents the number of the group to which the resident located on that cell belongs. Since residents are
     not modeled explicitly, as individual objects, but rather implicitly, as grid cell values, in this design,
     no object type <code>Resident</code>, but only an object type <code>GroupOfResidents</code> is defined for
     being able to assign different tolerance levels to different groups of residents.</p>
    <p>As a design choice, we abstract away from the real-world events described in the conceptual model, based
      on the assumption that their temporal dependency structure is not relevant for capturing the dynamics of the
      segregation process. Instead of modeling events as the basis of driving the simulation with a next-event
      time progression loop, the design relies on an abstract discrete time model and on implicit time step events
      driving the simulation with a fixed-increment time progression loop. Consequently, the information design
      model does not contain any event types.</p>
