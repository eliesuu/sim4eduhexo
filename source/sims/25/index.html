       content="A Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model is an epidemiological model that computes the theoretical number of individuals infected with a contagious disease in a closed population over time. The individuals in this population can be subdivided into a set of distinct classes, dependent upon their experience with respect to the disease. In the SIR model, we can assume that individuals are in one of three possible classes: Susceptible, Infectious or Recovered. Susceptible individuals have never come into contact with the disease and are able to contract the disease. Infectious individuals have the disease and can convey it to susceptible individuals via contact. Recovered individuals are cured of and immune to the disease for life. Individuals are born in the susceptible class. Thus, due to the contact with an infectious individual, a susceptible individual may contract the disease, after which the individual moves to the infectious class. Once infectious, the individual can spread the disease to other susceptible individuals via contact, yet after some time the individual is cured and moves to the recovered class. Depending on the characteristics of the population, individuals may have more or less contact to other individuals (I), which varies the speed in which the disease spreads. The disease spread and amount of infected individuals is influenced by the disease's contagiousness (β) and recoverability (g). The disease stops spreading when there is no susceptible or infectious individuals in the population."/>
