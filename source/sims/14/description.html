     <ol>
       <li>customers,</li>
       <li>service desks,</li>
       <li>service queues,</li>
       <li>service clerks.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>Notice that it seems preferable (more natural) to separate the service queue from the service desk and
       not consider the customer that is currently being served at the service desk to be part of the queue.</p>
     <p>Conceptually, a queue is a linearly ordered collection of objects of a certain type with a First-In-First-Out
       policy: the next object to be removed is the first object, at the front of the queue, while additional
       objects are added at the end of the queue.</p>
     <p>Potentially relevant types of events are:</p>
     <ol>
       <li>customer arrivals,</li>
       <li>customers queuing up,</li>
       <li>customers being notified/invited to move forward to the service desk,</li>
       <li>service start,</li>
       <li>service end,</li>
       <li>customer departures.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>Notice that a pair of start and end events, like "service start" and "service end", indicates that there is
      an activity that is temporally framed by these two events. It's an option to consider also activities, in addition
      to objects and events, in a conceptual model. We will do this in our <a href="https://sim4edu.com/sims/3/description.html">
      3rd simulation model</a> of the service desk system.</p>
     <p>Both object types and event types, together with their participation associations, can be visually described in
       a UML class diagram, as shown below.</p>

   <section><h1>Information Design Model <sup class="expl-req">?</sup></h1>
     <div id="expl-IDM" class="expl"></div>
     <p>In the given simulation project, the purpose of the simulation model is to compute only two statistics:
        <em>maximum queue length</em> and <em>average queue length</em>, both based on a single state variable: the length of the queue
         at the service desk. We may abstract away from all the object types listed in the conceptual information model
     and model the queue length state variable in the form of a global variable <code>queueLength</code>,
         and the service duration random variable in the form of a global function  <code>serviceDuration()</code>.</p>
     <p>Concerning the event types described in the conceptual information model, the goal is to keep
       only those of them, which are really needed, in the design model. This question is closely related
       to the question, which types of state changes and follow-up event creation have to be modeled for
       being able to answer the research question(s).</p>
     <p>In the case of the given research question, we only need to keep track of changes of the queue length.
         For keeping track of queue length changes, we only need to consider those types of events that may change the queue length:
         <em>customer arrivals</em> and <em>customer departures</em>. These are the only relevant event types.</p>
     <p>As an exogenous event type, <code>CustomerArrival</code> has a <code>recurrence</code> function representing
         a random variable for computing the time in-between two subsequent event occurrences.</p>
     <p>Notice that, for simplicity, we consider the customer that is currently being served to be part of the queue.
      In this way, in the simulation program, we can check if the service desk is busy by testing if the length of
      the queue is greater than 0.</p>
     <p>An alternative approach would be not considering the currently served customer as
       part of the queue, but rather use a Boolean attribute <code>isBusy</code> for being able to keep track if the
       service desk ist still busy with serving a customer.</p>
