   <div id="expl-DM" class="expl"></div>

   <p>In this model of the Department of Motor Vehicles, the two consecutive activities (reception and
     case handling) are modeled as service activities performed by two different service providers.
     The model allows to have service chains of any length.</p>

   <section><h1>Information Design Model <sup class="expl-req">?</sup></h1>
     <div id="expl-IDM" class="expl"></div>
     <p>A computational design for the purpose of computing the statistics <i>average time in system</i>
       and <i>service utilizations</i> is obtained by modeling the following types of objects, events and activities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Two object types: <b><code>ServiceProvider</code></b> and <b><code>Customer</code></b>, such that
	service desks (1) have a waiting line represented as a multi-valued reference property <code>waitingCustomers</code>
	defined by a corresponding association end, and (2) may have a successor service desk represented as a multi-valued 
	reference property <code>nextServiceProvider</code>	defined by a corresponding association end.</li>
    <li>One event type: <b><code>CustomerArrival</code></b> with a reference property <code>serviceProvider</code>
      for expressing that a customer arrives at a certain service desk. As an exogenous event type, <code>CustomerArrival</code>
      has a <code>recurrence</code> function representing a random variable for computing the time in-between
      two subsequent customer arrival events.</li>
    <li>One activity type: <b><code>Service</code></b> , having a resource association with the object type
      <code>ServiceProvider</code> (for expressing that a service is performed at a certain service desk) and
      having a function <code>randomDuration</code> representing a random variable that models the random
      variation of the duration of reception and case handling activities.</li>
  </ul>
     <p>In the scenario, the reception desk and the case handling desk are defined as service providers.
       The simulator automatically computes the utilization of both service desks (as a resource).</p>
     <p>The object types, event types and activity types described above, together with their participation
       associations, are visually described in the following UML class diagram:</p>

     <p>Notice that <i>t'</i> denotes the next moment in simulation time after <i>t</i>. If the simulation is using discrete time, then <i>t' = t+1</i>,
       else (if the simulation is using continuous time), then <i>t' = t + &Delta;t</i> where <i>&Delta;t</i> denotes the smallest time increment
       defined by the simulation model's time granularity.</p>
