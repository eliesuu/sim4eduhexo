       content="The LBE model is based on discrete time with days as time units. A month consists of a StartOfMonth event followed by 21 EachDay events representing the 21 consecutive working days of a month, which are followed by an EndOfMonth event. In addition to these three event types, the model is composed of the two object types Household and Firm. At the start of a month, firms adjust their wage rate and consumption goods price as well as their number of employees, while households search for cheaper vendors and for a job (if unemployed) or a better paid job (if employed), as well as decide on their monthly consumption budget. On each day, households purchase consumption goods and firms produce new consumption goods depending on their number of workers. At the end of a month, firms distribute profits, pay wages, and decide about firing a worker. Households receive their wage and may adjust their reservation wage."/>
