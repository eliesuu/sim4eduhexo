       content="The model defines four object types: Customer, Entrepreneur, Mafia and State. Entrepreneurs represent business owners who are engaged with producing and selling products or services. They make a number of decisions: (i) pay pizzo or not, if approached by Mafiosi, (ii) report pizzo requests to the State, (iii) report Mafia punishments to the State. The State represents institutions responsible for enforcing antiracket laws. It is composed of a set of police officers that can imprison Mafiosi based on general investigations or on specific investigations, which are more likely to succeed. After the police capture a Mafioso, they may find information about the entrepreneurs that paid pizzo to that Mafioso. The State can then use this evidence to elicit collaboration from those entrepreneurs. If collaboration is obtained, the State uses the collected information to prosecute that Mafioso. The State can also provide financial support to entrepreneurs who have suffered damages from a Mafia punishment. The Mafia represents a family covering a neighbourhood and is composed of Mafiosi that (i) request pizzo from entrepreneurs, (ii) provide protection to paying entrepreneurs, and (iii) punish non-paying entrepreneurs. Since they are part of the same family they coordinate their actions. The entrepreneurs decide on their own if they accept or decline the pizzo request, but every decision they make has consequences, good or bad. If entrepreneurs don't pay, they will be punished, e.g., by destroying their inventory."/>
