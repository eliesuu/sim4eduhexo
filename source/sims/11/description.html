   <div id="expl-DM" class="expl"></div>

   <p>In this model of the Department of Motor Vehicles, the two consecutive reception and
     case handling activities are modeled as the activities of two different processing nodes,
     using the standard modeling concepts of <i>Processing Networks</i>.</p>

   <section><h1>Information Design Model <sup class="expl-req">?</sup></h1>
     <div id="expl-IDM" class="expl"></div>
     <p>Since the simulation model is entirely based on the pre-defined <i>Processing Network</i> modeling concepts of
       <code>WorkObject</code>, <code>EntryNode</code>, <code>Arrival</code>, <code>ProcessingNode</code>, <code>ExitNode</code> 
       and <code>Departure</code>, there is no need to to define any object type or event type.</p>
     <p>The initial state definition consists of an entry node, two consecutive processing nodes, and an exit node.
     Since the number of arrivals at the entry node is limited by setting the entry node attribute <code>maxNmrOfArrivals</code>
     to 100, the simulations ends not because it reaches its end time, but because it runs out of future events (the FEL gets
     emptied).</p>
