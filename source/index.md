<section class="description"><h1>Web-Based Simulation for Science and Education</h1>
<div>
     <p>The <em>Simulation for Education (Sim4edu</em>) project website supports web-based simulation
      with open source technologies for science and education. It provides both <b><i>simulation
       technologies</i></b> and a <b><i>library of educational simulations</i></b>. Its goal is to support various
      styles of modeling and simulation, includingÂ <em>discrete event</em> simulation,
      <em>NetLogo</em>-style grid space models (and <em>Cellular Automata</em> models), and
      <em>agent</em>-based simulation.</p>
     <p>As opposed to traditional simulation technologies, <em>web-based</em> simulations,
      typically implemented with JavaScript, can be executed in any web browser, not just on desktop
      computers, but also on mobile devices like tablets and smartphones. This allows sharing
      simulations by means of simple web links and makes them easily accessible to anyone anywhere.
